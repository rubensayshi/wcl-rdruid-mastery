            Hey fellow tree, <br />
            <br />
            This tool works entirely in your browser without using a server backend to store or process things. <br />
            Because of this you need to get a warcraftlogs.com API key yourself, you can find this at the bottom of your accounts page; <a href="https://www.warcraftlogs.com/accounts/changeuser">here</a><br />
            <br />
            Everything will be stored inside your browser, so the API key is never leaked to the server or anything like that.<br />
            <br />
            This is the first, rather 'raw' version of this tool, <br />
            Currently it only analyzes when buffs are applied and removed and does not take into account how much healing is done.
